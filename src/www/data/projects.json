The lack of screen space led me to develop a custom module to display the individiual components in turn. The mirror displays the BBC top news stories, a clock, the current weather and the weather forecast among other things.",

Relatively few ARM binaries exist in the wild due to the large amount of resources, uncommonly found in ARM machines, required to build them. Fortunately, the Arch Linux ARM package repositories host the single latest binary, so I wrote a script to automatically check for and download new releases, packaging them in the same way as the official PhantomJS binaries for other architectures are packaged. The resulting archive can be found at <a href=\"https://phantomjs.barnabycolby.io\">https://phantomjs.barnabycolby.io</a>.",

Although the BBC offered a playback facility through iPlayer, this was not practical over a non-existant data connection. To solve the problem, I wrote a shell script to automatically download each new show and broadcast them as episodes of a podcast, available only in my home network. Without having to do anything, the new episodes were automatically downloaded to my phone overnight using my phones podcast application, completely solving the problem and offering a better experience.",

It would be tidier and easier to update if they were combined into a single repository, and should also include a script to set up the appropriate symlinks. Perhaps a systemd-timer unit can be created to ensure that the repository is always up to date on system boot. Inspiration can also be drawn from dotfiles.github.io."
