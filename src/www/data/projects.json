Relatively few ARM binaries exist in the wild due to the large amount of resources, uncommonly found in ARM machines, required to build them. Fortunately, the Arch Linux ARM package repositories host the single latest binary, so I wrote a script to automatically check for and download new releases, packaging them in the same way as the official PhantomJS binaries for other architectures are packaged. The resulting archive can be found at https://phantomjs.barnabycolby.io.",

This allowed me to work on my website from outside the house without allowing public ssh access to the web server. I also use it to provide more secure internet access when using public networks."

Although the BBC offered a playback facility through iPlayer, this was not practical over a non-existant data connection. To solve the problem, I wrote a shell script to automatically download each new show and broadcast them as episodes of a podcast, available only in my home network. Without having to do anything, the new episodes were automatically downloaded to my phone overnight using my phones podcast application, completely solving the problem and offering a better experience.",
