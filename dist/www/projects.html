In an effort to keep this list organised, I am documenting my past, current and future projects chronologically on this page.</blockquote></div></div><div class="jumbotron"><div id="current" class="container"><h1>Website</h1><p>This website was initially created to store a public listing of the projects I was working on, but now serves several other purposes. A nice side effect is that it gave me the opportunity to work with lots of new technologies and frameworks that I had wanted to play with, such as angular and grunt.</p><a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg" href="https://github.com/barnabycolby/barnabycolby.io" role="button" target="_blank">View on GitHub<i class="fa fa-github fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></div></div><div class="container"><h1 class="timeframe">Past</h1><div id="past" class="row"><div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="project col-md-4"><a href="https://github.com/barnabycolby/phantomjs-alarm" target="_blank"><h3>PhantomJS Alarm</h3><i class="fa fa-link fa-2x" aria-hidden="true"></i></a><p>My website build pipeline relies heavily on PhantomJS, which unfortunately has no official support for the ARM architecture. Relatively few ARM binaries exist in the wild due to the large amount of resources, uncommonly found in ARM machines, required to build them. Fortunately, the Arch Linux ARM package repositories host the single latest binary, so I wrote a script to automatically check for and download new releases, packaging them in the same way as the official PhantomJS binaries for other architectures are packaged. The resulting archive can be found at https://phantomjs.barnabycolby.io.</p></div></div><div><div class="project col-md-4"><h3>VPN Server</h3><p>I set up a VPN server using a raspberry pi connected to my home network. This allowed me to work on my website from outside the house without allowing public ssh access to the web server. I also use it to provide more secure internet access when using public networks.</p></div></div><div><div class="project col-md-4"><a href="https://github.com/barnabycolby/iplayerPodcast" target="_blank"><h3>iPlayer Podcast</h3><i class="fa fa-link fa-2x" aria-hidden="true"></i></a><p>As an avid listener of Zane Lowe on BBC Radio 1, I wanted to playback the shows during my commute. Although the BBC offered a playback facility through iPlayer, this was not practical over a non-existant data connection. To solve the problem, I wrote a shell script to automatically download each new show and broadcast them as episodes of a podcast, available only in my home network. Without having to do anything, the new episodes were automatically downloaded to my phone overnight using my phones podcast application, completely solving the problem and offering a better experience.</p></div></div><div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="project col-md-4"><a href="https://github.com/barnabycolby/screenSnake" target="_blank"><h3>screenSnake</h3><i class="fa fa-link fa-2x" aria-hidden="true"></i></a><p>I wrote a classic snake game in C++ that used the entirity of the screen space, overlaying it with a translucent background. It was tested on Linux and Windows but a points system was never added.</p></div></div><div><div class="project col-md-4"><a href="https://github.com/barnabycolby/Magneto" target="_blank"><h3>Magneto</h3><i class="fa fa-link fa-2x" aria-hidden="true"></i></a><p>Probably the earliest programming project I attempted was a C++ BitTorrent client. This was very amibitious at the time and shows in the resulting code. The project was never completed and likely never will be.</p></div></div></div><h1 class="timeframe">Future</h1><div id="future" class="row"><div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="project col-md-4"><a href="https://github.com/barnabycolby/SQRLClient" target="_blank"><h3>SQRL Android Application</h3><i class="fa fa-link fa-2x" aria-hidden="true"></i></a><p>I wrote a SQRL Client for Android as the Final Year Project for my undergraduate degree. The app can successfully be used to login to SQRL enabled servers but still has a ways to go to achieve full compatibility with the SQRL specification.</p></div></div><div><div class="project col-md-4"><a href="https://github.com/barnabycolby/backup" target="_blank"><h3>Backups</h3><i class="fa fa-link fa-2x" aria-hidden="true"></i></a><p>I want to write some backup software that will run on a Raspberry Pi connected to some hard drives. It should be simple enough to use that a non technical user could set it up with their own raspberry pi, providing an alternative solution to commercial cloud backup software.</p></div></div><div><div class="project col-md-4"><h3>Mail Server</h3><p>It would be useful to have my own mail server, allowing me to setup my own @barnabycolby.io email addresses, instead of having to search for available gmail usernames.</p></div></div><div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="project col-md-4"><h3>OCR Monospace Font browser plugin</h3><p>To help prevent phishing attacks, I want to create a browser plugin that displays the URL in an OCR monospace font, making devious characters more obvious in URLs such as amaz0n.com.</p></div></div><div><div class="project col-md-4"><h3>Improve dotfiles repositories</h3><p>I have several dotfile repositories on GitHub, each with a specified purpose. It would be tidier and easier to update if they were combined into a single repository, and should also include a script to set up the appropriate symlinks. Perhaps a systemd-timer unit can be created to ensure that the repository is always up to date on system boot. Inspiration can also be drawn from dotfiles.github.io.</p></div></div><div><div class="project col-md-4"><h3>Zane Lowe Apple Music Podcast</h3><p>In a similar vein to the iPlayer Podcast, the Zane Lowe shows broadcast live on Apple Music should be automatically recorded and broadcast as episodes of a local podcast. Research needs to be done into Apples secure HLS streams to see if this is even possible.</p></div></div><div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="project col-md-4"><h3>Podcast App</h3><p>I listen to a lot of podcasts, and whilst I&#39;m pretty happy with my current app, I think I can do slightly better. Writing another application would also be a good exercise in improving my Android skill set.</p></div></div><div><div class="project col-md-4"><h3>Todo App</h3><p>My todo list app is the most frequently used on my phone, but I have not found one that I like. Most of them are too complicated and contain lots of unnecessary features. I think I can do better.</p></div></div><div><div class="project col-md-4"><h3>Better DD-WRT Upgrading</h3><p>When upgrading DD-WRT, you have to reset your routers configuration before updating it and then manually configuring it again. This is so tedious that updates are less likely to happen. It would be better to retain the configuration during an update and even better to update the firmware automatically.</p></div></div><div><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="project col-md-4"><h3>Android LED Colour Manager</h3><p>Not all applications allow you to configure the colour of the LED notification light. Recent versions of Android allow a manager application to be created.</p></div></div></div></div><nav id="footer"><div class="container text-center"><a href="mailto:barnaby.colby@gmail.com" target="_blank" class="btn btn-default"><span class="fa fa-envelope-o" aria-hidden="true"></span> </a><a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/barnabycolby" target="_blank" class="btn btn-default"><span class="fa fa-linkedin" aria-hidden="true"></span> </a><a href="https://github.com/barnabycolby" target="_blank" class="btn btn-default"><span class="fa fa-github" aria-hidden="true"></span></a><div><p id="copyright" class="text-muted">&copy;&nbsp;<script>document.write((new Date).getFullYear())</script>&nbsp;Barnaby Colby.<span id="rightsreserved">&nbsp;All rights reserved.</span></p><p id="lastUpdated">This page was last updated on 31/07/2016.</p></div></div></nav></body></html>
